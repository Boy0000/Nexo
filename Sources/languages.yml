## This file can be used to create custom translation-keys for given languages or override existing keys
## This is the same as if you manually make the resourcepack JSON file for the given language
## Example of a key applied to all languages (global) and overriden specifically for en_us & en_gb
#global:
#  chat.greeting: "Hi"
#en_us:
#  chat.greeting: "Hello"
#en_gb:
#  chat.greeting: "G'day"
